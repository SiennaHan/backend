We are Team 9 taking 'software development principles and design' course 
held in 2019-01.
This is a long-term group project creating online web service.
We use React, React-Redux, Redux-Saga, Django, Django-Rest Framework.

We are trying to create a web service for designing and simulating 
uniforms for organizations/communities/schools/clubs etc. 
(Or so called "과잠" in South Korea.)

This web service also provides 
individual/group identification and group voting systems.
